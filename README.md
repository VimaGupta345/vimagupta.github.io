## About Me

I am a second year PhD student working on Systems for ML, in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">College of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Anand Iyer](https://www.anand-iyer.com/) and [Dr. Ada Gavrilovska](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/home/ada/). I am currently building robust systems for computationally expensive foundational models like LLMs. My ongoing projects and coursework are aligned towards creating a foundational understanding of distributed systems for large models.

### Ongoing Research

- Optimizing inference latency for Mixture of Expert models by leveraging runtime information and kernel optimization
- Designing scheduling policies for speeding up LLM inference for lower latency request and while gaining higher throughput using speculative decoding.
- Exploring the qubit mapping, routing and scheduling problem for trapped-ion based quantum computers, with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> TINKER group </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a>. (Master's thesis)
- Teaching neural networks how to count, under the guidance of [Dr. Sashank Varma](https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma). <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/91z2p9h1" target="_blank"> Poster at CogSci'22! </a>.

### Experience
I am currently interning with Microsoft Research in the AI Frameworks team where I am enriching the existing hand-written kernels for LLM inference through systematic performance models.

During summer of 2022, I explored ML compiler frameworks for [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/), where I had the opportunity to how make sparse attention faster on LLMs through MLIR transformation passes. Previously, I have co-founded PACE, a fitness [startup](https://create-x.gatech.edu/) with CREATE-X, aimed at remote physical therapy, leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques. 
 
Prior to my master's, I was a Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank"> Arm </a>  where I worked on physical design implementation of high performance and low power design at the sub-system level for Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm and 11nm) through floorplan co-design for big and little cores. During my undergrad, I also worked on <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank"> foggy channel modelling </a> for autonomous vehicles that led to Best Paper Award at IMICPW. You can find my resume <a href="docs/papers/Vima_Gupta_PhD_updated (5).pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>. 

### Interests and Hobbies

In my free time, I like to read on topics spanning mythology, psychology and ancient history. I am also huge TV show and movie buff and into casual quizzing.
