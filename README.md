## About Me

I am a first year Master's student in <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I am interested in building robust systems and frameworks that can support latest developments in the domain of machine learning. My ongoing projects and coursework are aligned towards creating a foundational understanding of Distributed Systems and Deep Learning.

### Ongoing Research

- Teaching neural networks how to count, under the guidance of <a href="https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma" target="_blank">Dr. Sashank Varma</a> from <a href="https://ic.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">School of Interactive Computing</a>.
- Exploring how high performance computing can be combined with quantum computing, with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> TINKER group </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a>.

### Publications

1. Gupta, V., & Varma, S. (2022, July). Learning to count: a neural network model of the successor function. Poster to be presented at the 44th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Toronto, Canada.
2. V. Gupta and R. Singhal, "Performance Analysis of a Visible Light Vehicle-To-Vehicle Wireless Communication System," 2019 TEQIP III Sponsored International Conference on Microwave Integrated Circuits, Photonics and Wireless Networks (IMICPW), 2019, pp. 521-523, doi: 10.1109/IMICPW.2019.8933276.

### Work Experience

I am currently working with <a href="https://www.paceworkout.com/" target="_blank"> PACE </a>, a fitness <a href="https://previewday.create-x.gatech.edu/company/pace" target="_blank"> startup with CREATE-X </a>  poised to take over the health care industry, leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques. I am also the Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS 6476 Computer Vision, OMSCS since Jan'21 where I work on design, autograder and evaluation of assignments and course projects. Prior to master's, I was a Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank"> Arm </a>  where I worked on physical design implementation of high performance and low power design at the sub-system level for Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm and 11nm). During my undergrad, I also worked on <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank"> foggy channel modelling </a> for autonomous vehicles that led to Best Paper Award at IMICPW. You can find my resume <a href="docs/papers/Fall_summer_resume (1).pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>. 

### Interests and Hobbies

In my free time, I like to read on topics spanning mythology, psychology and ancient history. I am also huge TV show and movie buff and into casual quizzing.
