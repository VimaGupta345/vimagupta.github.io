## About Me

I am a second year Master's student in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">College of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I am primarily interested in building robust systems and frameworks that can support latest developments in the domain of machine learning. My ongoing projects and coursework are aligned towards creating a foundational understanding of distributed systems for machine learning and other domain specific optimizations.

### Ongoing Research

- Teaching neural networks how to count, under the guidance of <a href="https://psychology.gatech.edu/sashank-varma" target="_blank">Dr. Sashank Varma</a> from <a href="https://ic.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">School of Interactive Computing</a>. (ArXiv link out soon!)
- Exploring the qubit mapping, routing and scheduling problem for trapped-ion based quantum computers, with <a href="http://prod.tinker.cc.gatech.edu/" target="_blank"> TINKER group </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/tom-conte" target="_blank">Dr. Tom Conte</a>.

### Projects

1. <a href="docs/papers/TINKER_report.pdf" target="_blank">Study</a>  of Sparse and General Matrix Multiplication techniques and code profiling of exascale computing proxy apps for better performance.
2. <a href="docs/papers/CAB_Biologically_Plausible_Meta_Learning_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank"> Meta-learning </a> biologically plausible update rules for unsupervised and semi-supervised representation learning.
3. <a href="docs/papers/ECE_6115_Project (3) (1).pdf" target="_blank"> Physical Design Aware NoC design </a> for the DNN Inference Accelerator, Multiply-Accumulate Engine with Reconfigurable Interconnect.

### Work Experience

I am currently working with <a href="https://www.paceworkout.com/" target="_blank"> PACE </a>, a fitness <a href="https://previewday.create-x.gatech.edu/company/pace" target="_blank"> startup with CREATE-X </a>  poised to take over the health care industry, leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques. I am also the Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS 6476 Computer Vision, OMSCS since Jan'21 where I work on design, autograder and evaluation of assignments and course projects. Prior to master's, I was a Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank"> Arm </a>  where I worked on physical design implementation of high performance and low power design at the sub-system level for Arm V7-V9 cores (4nm, 5nm and 11nm). During my undergrad, I also worked on <a href="docs/papers/Performance_Analysis_of_a_Visible_Light_Vehicle-To-Vehicle_Wireless_Communication_System.pdf" target="_blank"> foggy channel modelling </a> for autonomous vehicles that led to Best Paper Award at IMICPW. You can find my resume <a href="docs/papers/Fall_summer_resume (1).pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>. 

### Interests and Hobbies

In my free time, I like to read on topics spanning mythology, psychology and ancient history. I am also huge TV show and movie buff and into casual quizzing.
